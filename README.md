This is a simple distributed BlockChain made in Java. 

To use this, It`s very simple:
Compile the java files from the command "javac example/*.java" though the terminal
Run the command "java example.DistributedApp 8888 true" on the machine you want to be the miner
"java example.DistributedApp 8889 false <miners ip address>:8888" on the machines that will effectively be the "Users"
